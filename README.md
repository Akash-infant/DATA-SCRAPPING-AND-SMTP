Developed a SEO Tool to Analyse Live Web Pages

In my project, I implemented web scraping techniques to extract data from the NSE (National Stock Exchange) website, specifically focusing on legal content. This data was efficiently stored in Excel format for subsequent analysis and visualization. Additionally, I integrated SMTP in Python to seamlessly transfer these processed datasets, enhancing the project's efficiency and enabling streamlined communication.
